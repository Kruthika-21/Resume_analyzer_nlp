Projects
Design of a Smart Time Switch
A prototype was implemented on the LPC2148 microcontroller using assembly C. It integrates RTC for 
the timer start time and duration. It provides an interface to interact with the microcontroller using a 
set of switches and a LCD.

Lazy Memory Allocation in XV6
Modified the XV6 kernel to support lazy allocation of pages and implemented additional system calls 
to display number of physical and virtual pages for a given process.

Visual Representation of Dijkstra's Algorithm
Implemented in the form of a Web Interface using HTML, CSS and JS. Provides a way graphical 
interface to modify the graph and shows the shortest path between a pair of vertices along the steps 
taken to achieve it.
